# Minecraft-Server-Mac
This repository is for setting up a Minecraft: Java Edition Server on macOS. The Pocket Edition is also supported. Both servers are for the current Minecraft version 1.18.2 (Java Edition) and 1.18.20 (Pocket Edition). Optionally you can install my Minecraft server GUI from here.
